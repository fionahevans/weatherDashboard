  Rainfall to date charts provide an snapshot of how the season's rainfall is tracking compared to past rainfall (deciles 1, 5 and 9).The charts also show how the season might end by adding amounts of rainfall that have been historically recieved in the remainder of the growing season (projected deciles 1, 5 and 9). See the DPIRD

tool for more information and additional options.

Cumulative rainfall to date and the projected decile finishes are used to estimate growign season rainfall in the potential yield calculation.
