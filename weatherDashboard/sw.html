  Plant available soil water is modelled using the Ritchie two-layer fallow evaporation model described in Ritchie, J.T. 1972, "Model for predicting evaporation from a row crop with incomplete cover".

The break of season is assumed to occur if there is 25mm of rainfall over three days after 25 April and before 5 June, or if there is 5mm of rainfall over three days after 5 June.
Crop evapotranspiration (assuming a wheat crop) is estimated using the FAO crop factor method with coefficeients suited to wheat cropping in WA. </p>
